## **Visualizations and Key Findings**

**Below are some of the visualizations**

The plotted data represents the trend in total steps taken over a period of time. Initially, there is a gradual and consistent decline in the number of steps recorded with fluctuations, indicating a potential shift in activity levels. However, what stands out most prominently is the sudden and steep decline observed towards the end of the time frame. This sharp decline could signify a significant change in behavior or external factors impacting step count. Further investigation into this sharp decline could reveal valuable insights into the underlying reasons for the observed trend.

The presented plot illustrates a woman's consistent activity level in terms of total steps over the span of a month. Despite maintaining a steady performance, there are noticeable fluctuations on certain days, indicating variability in her routine. Some days stand out with notably higher step counts, showcasing her capacity for increased activity. However, as the month progresses, there's a gradual decline in her overall activity, suggesting a potential change in her exercise routine.

This composite plot offers a comprehensive perspective on individual women's total steps over a 31-day span. Each woman's activity trend is depicted in a separate facet, allowing for direct comparison. While some exhibit consistent patterns with occasional fluctuations, others showcase varying levels of daily steps.

The presented histogram provides insight into the distribution of sleep durations among participants. The x-axis represents the total minutes asleep, with the y-axis indicating the frequency of occurrences. The histogram showcases a range of sleep durations, from a minimum of 58 minutes to a maximum of 796 minutes, with an average of approximately 419.47 minutes.

This scatter plot illustrates the connection between two variables: total minutes asleep and total time in bed. The x-axis represents the total minutes asleep, while the y-axis signifies the total time spent in bed. The green regression line highlights a strong positive correlation (0.920414) between these two variables. This indicates that as sleep duration increases, there is a tendency for longer time spent in bed.There are a few outliers on the scatter plot, which indicates that there are some people who do not follow the general trend.

## **A summary of analysis**

The analysis of the smart device data has revealed some interesting trends that could be applied to Bellabeat customers and inform their marketing strategy.Here are the key findings based on the analysis:

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a decline in activity levels over time.**</div> This is evident in the total steps taken, total distance covered, and calories burned data. This trend could be due to a number of factors, such as busy schedules, changes in weather, or simply boredom with the same old workout routine. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to encourage users to stay active, even when they're feeling unmotivated. They could offer new workout challenges, provide access to workout classes, or simply send motivational messages to their users.

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a lot of variability in sleep patterns.**</div> This is evident in the total minutes asleep and total time in bed data. Some users get a consistent 8 hours of sleep per night, while others have much more variable sleep patterns. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to help users improve their sleep quality. They could offer tips on sleep hygiene, provide access to sleep tracking apps, or even sell sleep products.

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a strong correlation between weight and BMI.**</div> This means that as weight increases, BMI also increases. This is to be expected, as BMI is a measure of body fat, and weight is a major component of body fat. Bellabeat could use this information to target their marketing efforts to users who are overweight or obese. They could offer weight loss programs, provide access to healthy recipes, or even sell fitness trackers.

<div style="color: blue;">**A large proportion of reports are manual.**</div> This suggests that there is a need for Bellabeat to improve their automated data collection process. They could invest in new software or hire more staff to help with data entry. This would free up their users to focus on their health and wellness goals, rather than spending time entering data manually.

<div style="color: blue;">**The majority of participants are classified as "Normal weight" or "Overweight."**</div> This suggests that Bellabeat has a good mix of users, from those who are looking to maintain a healthy weight to those who are looking to lose weight. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to both groups of users, offering different products and services to meet their individual needs.


#### **Influence on Marketing Strategy**

* **Activity-focused Campaigns:** Bellabeat can run campaigns promoting the benefits of consistent physical activity, highlighting the connection between activity levels and overall health. This can attract users who are looking for holistic health solutions.

* **Sleep Improvement Initiatives:** Marketing efforts can emphasize the importance of quality sleep and how Bellabeat's products can help users achieve better sleep patterns. Testimonials and success stories can reinforce these messages.

## **Recommendations Based on Analysis**

Here are the recommendations based on the analysis:

* **Create a challenge to encourage users to increase their activity levels.** This could be a step challenge, a distance challenge, or a calorie burn challenge. Bellabeat could offer prizes to the winners of the challenge to motivate users to participate.
* **Offer a sleep tracking app or program.** This would help users track their sleep patterns and identify areas where they can improve their sleep quality. Bellabeat could also offer tips on sleep hygiene and provide access to relaxing music or sounds to help users fall asleep.
* **Create a weight loss program.** This could include meal plans, workout routines, and support from a coach. Bellabeat could also offer discounts on fitness trackers or other products that can help users lose weight.
* **Improve their automated data collection process.** This would free up their users to focus on their health and wellness goals, rather than spending time entering data manually.
* **Target their marketing efforts to specific groups of users.** This could include users who are looking to maintain a healthy weight, users who are looking to lose weight, or users who are interested in improving their sleep quality.
* **Offer products and services that meet the individual needs of their users.** This could include fitness trackers, workout clothes, meal plans, or weight loss programs.
* **Add more data points to monitor users behavior.** This could include age,diet of food eaten every day, residence etc. This kind of data points will add to the analysis depth and understanding of the users.


#### **Recommendations for New Fitness Clients:**

* **Activity:** New fitness clients should aim for a daily step count and distance similar to the analyzed averages. Gradual increases in activity can lead to improved health outcomes.

* **Sleep:** Clients should focus on maintaining consistent sleep schedules and durations. Prioritizing sleep quality through relaxation techniques and sleep hygiene practices is essential.

* **Weight Management:** Clients should be educated about the correlation between weight and BMI. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and consultation with healthcare professionals can aid in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

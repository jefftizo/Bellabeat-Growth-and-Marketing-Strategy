```{r}
#Filter specific records
fitnesswomenTTIB <- cleansleepday_df %>%
  filter(Id %in% c(8378563200))

```




**3. Clean and manipulate "weightloginfo_df"**


Check the datatypes for all columns if are correct.

```{r}
glimpse(weightloginfo_df)
```


Convert the "Date" column from character to datetime format using the specified format. Add new column "DateOnly" with only the date part and another column "TimeOnly" with only the time part extracted from the datetime values in the "Date" column.

```{r}
#Change the date column datatype from chr to datetime
weightloginfo_df$Date <- as.POSIXct(weightloginfo_df$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")

#Create a column for date only
weightloginfo_df$DateOnly <- as.Date(weightloginfo_df$Date)

#Create a column for Time only
weightloginfo_df$TimeOnly <- format(weightloginfo_df$Date, format = "%H:%M:%S")


```



**Arrange columns in the order you want** and ignore columns you will not need in analysis in this case **Fat column** because it has missing values.

```{r}
#select and arrange columns
cleanweightloginfo_df <- select(weightloginfo_df,Id,DateOnly,TimeOnly,WeightKg,WeightPounds,BMI,IsManualReport,LogId)
```


View first 6 records.

```{r}
#View data
head(cleanweightloginfo_df)
```


**Weightinfo data statistics**

Some of this information can be used in guiding and advising new fitness clients. 

```{r}
# Calculate statistics
weightinfo_totalrecords <- nrow(cleanweightloginfo_df)
weightinfo_totaldays <- length(unique(cleanweightloginfo_df$DateOnly))
weightinfo_totalparticipants <- length(unique(cleanweightloginfo_df$Id))
mean_weight <- mean(cleanweightloginfo_df$WeightKg)
min_weight <- min(cleanweightloginfo_df$WeightKg)
max_weight <- max(cleanweightloginfo_df$WeightKg)


# Print the calculated statistics
cat("Total Weightinfo Records:", weightinfo_totalrecords, "\n")
cat("Total Weightinfo collection Days:", weightinfo_totaldays, "\n")
cat("Total women participants:", weightinfo_totalparticipants, "\n")
cat("Average Weight:", mean_weight, "\n")
cat("Minimum Weight:", min_weight, "\n")
cat("Maximum Weight:", max_weight, "\n")

```

Calculate the correlation coefficient between weight and BMI. Correlation between Weight and BMI: 0.7356837. The key finding is that there is a strong positive relationship between weight and BMI.In other words, as weight increases, BMI also increases. This is to be expected, as BMI is a measure of body fat, and weight is a major component of body fat.

```{r}
correlation <- cor(cleanweightloginfo_df$WeightKg, cleanweightloginfo_df$BMI)
cat("Correlation between Weight and BMI:", correlation, "\n")

```


The code analyzes weight log reports and categorizes them based on manual input. There are 26 reports marked as "Not Manual" (IsManualReport = FALSE) and 41 as "Manual" (IsManualReport = TRUE). The data is grouped by the manual reporting status, and then the count of reports in each category is calculated. 

```{r}
# Group the data and calculate the counts
grouped_IsManualReport <- cleanweightloginfo_df %>%
  group_by(IsManualReport) %>%
  summarize(no_of_reports = n())

grouped_IsManualReport
```

The code creates a new column in the dataset called "BMI_Category" that categorizes individuals based on their BMI values. The categories include "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," "Obesity," and various classes of obesity. The code then counts the occurrences of each BMI category.
After categorization, the analysis shows that the dataset contains three distinct BMI categories:

* Class III Obesity: Only 1 participant falls into this category.
* Normal weight: 34 participants fall within the "Normal weight" category.
* Overweight: 32 participants are categorized as "Overweight."

```{r}
# Create a new column with the BMI categories
BMI_category_Count <- cleanweightloginfo_df %>%
  mutate(BMI_Category = case_when(
    BMI < 18.5 ~ "Underweight",
    BMI >= 18.5 & BMI < 25 ~ "Normal weight",
    BMI >= 25 & BMI < 30 ~ "Overweight",
    BMI >= 30 & BMI < 35 ~ "Obesity",
    BMI >= 35 & BMI < 40 ~ "Class I Obesity",
    BMI >= 40 & BMI < 45 ~ "Class II Obesity",
    BMI >= 45 ~ "Class III Obesity"
  ))

# Count the occurrences of each BMI category
counted_categories <- BMI_category_Count %>%
  group_by(BMI_Category) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

counted_categories

```

This scatter plot illustrates the connection between two variables: total minutes asleep and total time in bed. The x-axis represents the total minutes asleep, while the y-axis signifies the total time spent in bed. The green regression line highlights a strong positive correlation (0.920414) between these two variables. This indicates that as sleep duration increases, there is a tendency for longer time spent in bed.There are a few outliers on the scatter plot, which indicates that there are some people who do not follow the general trend.

**3. Visualizations and Key Findings of "cleanweightloginfo_df"**


The histogram displays the distribution of recorded weights in kilograms. The x-axis shows weight intervals of 9 kg each, while the y-axis represents the frequency of weights falling within each interval. The graph indicates a common weight range around 45-54 kg, with an average weight of 72.04 kg. The minimum and maximum weights are 52.6 kg and 133.5 kg, respectively.

```{r}
ggplot(cleanweightloginfo_df, aes(x = WeightKg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 9, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Weight (Kg)", 
       y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Distribution of Weight in Kilograms",
       subtitle=paste0("Frequency Distribution of Recorded Weights"),
       caption=paste0("Prepared by Mr. Jefferson Mwatati"))

```


The pie chart illustrates the distribution of manual and automatic reports. Manual reports make up the majority of the generated reports at 61%, indicating that a significant portion of data entry is done manually.
Automatic reports contribute to 39% of the total reports, suggesting that there's a mix of automated and manual data collection.

```{r}
# Create a pie chart with percentages
ggplot(grouped_IsManualReport, aes(x = "", y = no_of_reports, fill = factor(IsManualReport))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(fill = "IsManualReport",
       title = "Manual and Automatic Reports",
       subtitle=paste0("Proportion of Reports Generated Manually and Automatically"),
       caption=paste0("Prepared by Mr. Jefferson Mwatati")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "purple", "FALSE" = "orange")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(no_of_reports / sum(no_of_reports))), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_void()


```



The pie chart represents the distribution of different BMI categories among individuals. The largest portion of participants falls under the "Normal weight" category, constituting 50.7% of the individuals, indicating a significant proportion of healthy weight individuals.The "Overweight" category accounts for 47.8% of the distribution, suggesting a substantial proportion of participants are classified as overweight based on their BMI.While relatively small in proportion at 1.5%, the presence of individuals in the "Class III Obesity" category indicates that some participants have a severe level of obesity.

## **A summary of analysis**

The analysis of the smart device data has revealed some interesting trends that could be applied to Bellabeat customers and inform their marketing strategy.Here are the key findings based on the analysis:

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a decline in activity levels over time.**</div> This is evident in the total steps taken, total distance covered, and calories burned data. This trend could be due to a number of factors, such as busy schedules, changes in weather, or simply boredom with the same old workout routine. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to encourage users to stay active, even when they're feeling unmotivated. They could offer new workout challenges, provide access to workout classes, or simply send motivational messages to their users.

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a lot of variability in sleep patterns.**</div> This is evident in the total minutes asleep and total time in bed data. Some users get a consistent 8 hours of sleep per night, while others have much more variable sleep patterns. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to help users improve their sleep quality. They could offer tips on sleep hygiene, provide access to sleep tracking apps, or even sell sleep products.

<div style="color: blue;">**There is a strong correlation between weight and BMI.**</div> This means that as weight increases, BMI also increases. This is to be expected, as BMI is a measure of body fat, and weight is a major component of body fat. Bellabeat could use this information to target their marketing efforts to users who are overweight or obese. They could offer weight loss programs, provide access to healthy recipes, or even sell fitness trackers.

<div style="color: blue;">**A large proportion of reports are manual.**</div> This suggests that there is a need for Bellabeat to improve their automated data collection process. They could invest in new software or hire more staff to help with data entry. This would free up their users to focus on their health and wellness goals, rather than spending time entering data manually.

<div style="color: blue;">**The majority of participants are classified as "Normal weight" or "Overweight."**</div> This suggests that Bellabeat has a good mix of users, from those who are looking to maintain a healthy weight to those who are looking to lose weight. Bellabeat could target their marketing efforts to both groups of users, offering different products and services to meet their individual needs.
